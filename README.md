# web-technologies-project
Web Development project based on web-based grocery shopping platform built using JSP, Servlets, and MySQL.
The Online Grocery Ordering System is a web-based application developed using JSP, Servlets, and MySQL.
It allows customers to browse grocery items, add them to a cart, and place online orders, while admins can manage inventory and view all customer orders.

This project follows a Three-Tier Architecture:
Presentation Layer (JSP + HTML + CSS) – for user interaction.
Business Logic Layer (Java Servlets) – for request processing.
Data Layer (MySQL) – for data storage and retrieval.
